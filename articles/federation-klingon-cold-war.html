      <h1>Federation&ndash;Klingon Cold War</h1>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <h2>Rising tensions</h2>
      <h2>Open war</h2>

      <h2>Klingon&ndash;Romulan alliance</h2>
      <p>In <a href="golden-age-of-exploration.html#2274">2274</a>, a military alliance was negotiated between the Klingon Empire and the usually isolationist <a href="romulan-star-empire.html">Romulan Star Empire</a>. By this time, relations between the Klingons and the Federation were souring. Meanwhile, the Romulans were alarmed by the formidable power the Federation had become. They wanted a chance to test their own strength against the Federation's. The Klingons and Romulans coordinated their efforts to undermine the Federation, shared intelligence, and exchanged a limited amount of technology. Their long-term goal was to launch a joint invasion of the Federation.</p>
      <h3>Organian incident</h3>
      <p>In <a href="golden-age-of-exploration.html#2277">2277</a>, arduous negotiations between the Federation and the Klingon Empire broke down. The Klingons launched a series of small surprise attacks on numerous Starfleet vessels along the Federation&ndash;Klingon border and quickly seized the strategically located neutral planet of Organia. The <a href="klingon-empire.html#government">Klingon High Council</a> chose to take these actions without first consulting their Romulan allies.</p>
      <p>When the entire <a href="klingon-empire.html#military">Klingon Imperial Fleet</a> was suddenly immobilized by an unknown force, the Romulan Star Empire refused to offer any assistance. Both Starfleet and Klingon forces had been neutralized by the Organians, who revealed themselves to be immensely powerful, incorporeal beings. The Organians oversaw treaty negotiations between the Federation and the Klingon Empire, putting an end to the short-lived war.</p>
      <p>[Treaty of Organia]</p>
      <p>While the Federation and the Klingon Empire still antagonized each other, the treaty eased the tensions between them. This, combined with the Klingons' failure to include the Romulans in their invasion plans, angered the Romulan Star Empire. This chain of events threatened to undo the Klingon&ndash;Romulan alliance. However, the Klingons, fearing they would be outmatched by the Federation without Romulan support, preserved the alliance by increasing their contributions to the technological exchange, supplying the Romulans with multiple <a href="d7-class.html">D7 class</a> <a href="spacecraft-types.html#cruiser">cruisers</a>. By the late <a href="golden-age-of-exploration.html#2280s">2280s</a>, the Romulan Star Empire had in turn supplied the Klingons with the schematics for their <a href="brel-class.html">newest class</a> of <a href="spacecraft-types.html#bird-of-prey">Bird-of-Prey</a>, including its state of the art cloaking technology.</p>
      <h3>Genesis controversy</h3>
      <p>In <a href="golden-age-of-exploration.html#2290">2290</a>, the Klingons discovered that the Federation had developed the Genesis Device, a terraforming technology that could also be used to eradicate life. In his search for the secret of Genesis, the Klingon Commander Kruge was killed by Starfleet Admiral James Kirk. Despite the fact that Kirk was acting without authorization from Starfleet, the Klingon Empire cut off all diplomatic relations with the Federation and withdrew from all existing agreements between the two powers, including the <a href="federation-klingon-war.html#peace">Treaty of Pahvo</a> and the <a href="#organian-incident">Treaty of Organia</a>.</p>
      <p>However, as the Federation braced for a new war with the Klingon Empire, the Romulan Star Empire, for no apparent reason, rescinded their secret alliance with the Klingons and established diplomatic relations with the Federation. With the sole exception of the <a href="earth-romulan-war.html#peace">Earth&ndash;Romulan Treaty of 2160</a>&mdash;that was negotiated over subspace radio&mdash;the Romulans had never before had any kind of diplomatic relationship with any member of the Federation. With the end of the Klingon&ndash;Romulan alliance, the Klingon Empire, now more cut off from the rest of the galaxy than ever before, entered into a period of total isolationism.</p>
