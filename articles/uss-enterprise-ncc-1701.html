      <p>The <strong>USS Enterprise</strong> was a <a href="united-federation-of-planets.html">Federation</a>-owned <a href="constitution-class.htlm">Constitution-class</a> <a href="spacecraft-types.html#heavy-cruiser">heavy cruiser</a> in <a href="starfleet.html">Starfleet</a> service from <a href="age-of-federation-expansion.html#2260">2260</a> to <a href="golden-age-of-exploration.html#2290">2290</a>. After it was commissioned, it served as the Federation's flagship until <a href="golden-age-of-exploration.html#2285">2285</a>, after which it served as a training vessel until it was destroyed in 2290. During its service, it underwent one notable refit in <a href="golden-age-of-exploration.html#2280">2280</a>.</p>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <h3>Construction and launch</h3>
      <p>During the <a href="federation-klingon-cold-war.html#rising-tensions">first decade of the Federation&ndash;Klingon Cold War</a>, <a href="starfleet.html">Starfleet</a> engineers began designing a next-generation class of <a href="spacecraft-types.html#heavy-cruiser">heavy cruisers</a> that would become the <a href="constitution-class.html">Constitution class.</a> Overseen by <a href="starfleet.html#ranks">Captain</a> Robert April, the construction of these vessels&mdash;including the Enterprise&mdash;took place at the planet Axanar.</p>
      <p>Following the outbreak of the <a href="federation-klingon-war.html">Federation&ndash;Klingon War</a> in <a href="age-of-federation-expansion.html#2256">2256</a>, construction of the Constitution-class starships was fast-tracked. Retired Fleet Admiral Jonathan Archer attended the Enterprise's launch in <a href="age-of-federation-expansion.html#2260">2260</a>, days before the Battle of Axanar, when the Enterprise, under April's command, played a pivotal role in the <a href="united-federation-of-planets.html">Federation</a>'s victory over the <a href="klingon-empire.html">Klingons</a>, decisively ending the war.</p>
      <h3>April's five-year mission</h3>
      <p>Following the end of the Federation&ndash;Klingon War, the Enterprise embarked on a five-year mission under Captain April's command, charting stellar phenomena such as the Delta Scuti star 99 Pegasi, and rendering aid to numerous groups, including the colonists of Tarsus IV, the Perricans, the inhabitants of Na'rel, and the Ohawk of Man-us II. Under April, the Enterprise's command crew included Executive and Chief Flight Control Officer Commander Christopher Pike, Chief Science Officer Lieutenant Commander Una Chin-Riley, Chief Security Officer Lieutenant D. Nhan, Chief Engineering Officer Lieutenant Hemmer, Chief Medical Officer Lieutenant Sarah April, Chief Tactical Officer Lieutenant Junior Grade Jos&eacute; Tyler, and Chief Operations Officer Crewman Garison.</p>
      <h3>Pike's first five-year mission</h3>
      <p>In <a href="golden-age-of-exploration.html#2265">2265</a>, Captain April was promoted. He and Sarah left the Enterprise, and command fell to Pike. Chin-Riley was promoted to Executive Officer in addition to taking on the role of Chief Flight Control Officer, Lieutenant Spock joined the command crew as the new Chief Science Officer, and Lieutenant Phil Boyce joined as the new Chief Medical Officer. The Enterprise set out on a second five-year mission.</p>
      <p>Following a violent encounter with the Kalar on Rigel VII, the Enterprise was en route to the Vega colonie, when they received a distress signal from the crew of the SS Columbia, who had crash-landed on Talos IV years earlier. This turned out to be a trap. Pike was captured by the Talosians, but eventually, he outwitted his captors, who then allowed the Enterprise to leave in peace.</p>
      <p>At the Federation&ndash;Klingon border planet Cajitar IV, the crew of the Enterprise unearthed a false flag operation by a criminal syndicate known as the Broken Circle to start a new war between the Federation and the Klingon Empire. The Broken Circle had salvaged the wreck of the USS Crossfield and restored it to operating condition, planning to use it to attack the Klingons. The Enterprise failed to stop the Crossfield, and war broke out. Pike sought out the monks of Boreth in hopes of using one of their time crystals to prevent the war from ever taking place. The monks agreed, but in using the crystal, Pike witnessed and sealed his own fate.</p>
      <h3>Pike's second five-year mission</h3>
      <p>After undergoing some routine maintenance at Starbase 1, the Enterprise began its third five-year mission in <a href="golden-age-of-exploration.html#2270">2270</a>, again under Pike's command. Lieutenant Commander Joseph M'Benga succeeded Boyce as Chief Medical Officer, Lieutenant La'An Noonien-Singh succeeded Nhan as Chief Security Officer, Lieutenant Junior Grade Erica Ortegas succeeded Chin-Riley as Chief Flight Control Officer, and Senior Cadet Nyota Uhura succeeded Garison as Chief Operations Officer.</p>
      <p>By the end of the year, the crew of the Enterprise had established good relations with the Kiley following a rocky first contact, successfully rendered aid to the Deleb while respecting the wishes of the Shepherds, narrowly avoided destruction while investigating an abandoned Illyrian colony, and barely survived a harrowing encounter with the Gorn. Following this encounter, the Enterprise returned to Starbase 1. There, while the ship underwent repairs, the crew enjoyed some relaxing shore leave and Pike successfully negotiated an alliance with the R'ongovians.</p>
      <p>After the repairs, the Enterprise resumed its mission, rendering aid to the Majalans, defeating the pirates of the Serene Squall, surveying the Jonisian Nebula, and investigating the fate of USS Peregrine, a mission that led to Hemmer's death during a second conflict with the Gorn. After this encounter, the Enterprise traveled to the Federation&ndash;<a href="romulan-star-empire.html">Romulan</a> Neutral Zone to help supply and upgrade the Earth Outpost Stations. During the mission, Chin-Riley was arrested for violations of Starfleet's anti-genetic modification directive.</p>
      <p>After a brief return to earth, the Enterprise resumed its mission following Chin-Riley's acquittal and Lieutenant Pelia's appointment as new Chief Engineering Officer. Over the following year, the Enterprise returned to Rigel VII and brought an end to the continual memory loss faced by the Kalar, saved a species residing in Bannon's Nebula from destruction, encountered two time-traveling Starfleet Ensigns and successfully returned them to their own time, received Ambassador Dak'Rah, son of Ra'Ul, who was then murdered by M'Benga while en route to Starbase 12, undid a musical reality that had been spreading from a subspace fold, and came to the brink of war after a Gorn attack on the Federation world of Parnassus Beta.</p>
      <h3>Kirk's five-year mission</h3>
      <p>In <a href="golden-age-of-exploration.html#2275">2275</a>, following fifteen years of service aboard the Enterprise, Pike was promoted to fleet captain and Chin-Riley was given command of the USS Archer. Command of the Enterprise was transferred to newly-promoted Captain James Kirk. Spock succeeded Chin-Riley as Executive Officer while also continuing as Chief Science Officer, Lieutenant Junior Grade Stiles succeeded Tyler as Chief Tactical Officer, Lieutenant Hikaru Sulu succeeded Ortegas as Chief Flight Control Officer, Ensign Pavel Chekov succeeded Noonien-Singh as Chief Security Officer, Lieutenant Commander Montgomery Scott succeeded Pelia as Chief Engineering Officer, and Lieutenant Commander Leonard McCoy succeeded M'Benga as Chief Medical Officer. The Enterprise undertook another five-year mission.</p>

Discoveries

From 2265 to 2270, the Enterprise visited over seventy different worlds and encountered representatives of over sixty different species. More than twenty of those were first contacts with beings previously unknown to the Federation, including stellar neighbors like the First Federation and Gorn, voyagers from the Kelvan Empire in distant Andromeda, and powerful non-corporeal entities like the Thasians, Trelane, and the Organians. (TOS: , "The Corbomite Maneuver", "Arena", "By Any Other Name") Two discovered species were the first known examples of silicon-based lifeforms: the Horta and the Excalbians. (TOS: "The Devil in the Dark", "The Savage Curtain", "That Which Survives")

USS Enterprise leaving galactic barrier, remastered
In the barrier void in 2265
The Enterprise was the first Federation vessel to survive an encounter with the galactic barrier. The ship's warp drive and other systems, however, were critically damaged (which later prompted the ship to be refit and repaired, changing its appearance slightly for the rest of Kirk's mission) and casualties totaled twelve crewmembers and officers. By stardate 4657.5, the Enterprise was traveling through space in a region hundreds of light years further than any Earth starship had explored. (TOS: "Where No Man Has Gone Before", "Return to Tomorrow")

The reality of time travel, externally influenced, had been known for over a century, but following two accidental temporal displacements, the Enterprise became the Federation's first deliberately-controlled timeship. Observing the death-throes of Psi 2000, the crew suffered from polywater intoxication and the Enterprise nearly lost orbit after an engine shutdown. A previously untested "cold start", via controlled matter-antimatter implosion, saved the ship, but the high-speed escape from the planet's gravity well caused the ship to travel three days into the past. (TOS: "The Naked Time")

Orbiting 1960s Earth
In 2267, while escaping the gravitational pull of a black star, the Enterprise was hurled through space and time to Earth of 1969. The crew developed and executed a method to return to their own time, by warping around the sun's gravity well in a slingshot maneuver. A year later, the Enterprise was ordered to repeat the recently proven slingshot effect, and returned to Earth's past on a mission of historical observation. (TOS: "Tomorrow is Yesterday", "Assignment: Earth")

Originally, "The Naked Time" and "Tomorrow is Yesterday" were planned to be back-to-back stories, with the events in "Tomorrow is Yesterday" happening as a result of the "cold start" of the warp drive in "The Naked Time". A change in production plans resulted in the two stories being de-linked and slightly reworked to stand alone.

The space amoeba in 2268
Some missions of discovery confronted Enterprise with entities and mechanisms that threatened great swaths of Federation and neighboring space.

An ancient "planet killer", fueled by the consumption of planets it destroyed with its antiproton weapon, approached Federation population centers in 2267. It required the combined efforts of the Enterprise and its "sister ship", USS Constellation, to destroy the invader. (TOS: "The Doomsday Machine")

One year later, in 2268, a single-cell organism of colossal scale emitted negative energy, toxic to humanoid life, killing the entire Vulcan crew of the USS Intrepid. The Enterprise penetrated the cell interior and destroyed the organism before its imminent cell division threatened to overwhelm the rest of the galaxy. (TOS: "The Immunity Syndrome")

In around 2268, the Enterprise visited Planet 0042692 where they detected an approaching catastrophe, but couldn't intervene directly due to the Prime Directive. Ensign David Garrovick volunteered to embark upon a solo mission in the shuttle Galileo, but the Galileo ended up crashing. The Enterprise departed the planet without Garrovick after which no other Starfleet ship would visit that sector for over a hundred years and there was no record of first contact. Having survived the crash, Garrovick predicted that Starfleet would return one day and sent out a distress call. Learning about Starfleet from Garrovick, the planet's natives began calling themselves Enderprizians, named their settlement New Enda-Prize, and adopted versions of the Enterprise crew's names. (PRO: "All the World's a Stage")

Battles

The nature of its mission of exploration meant the Enterprise was frequently the only Federation military asset in a little-known, otherwise undefended frontier. When called into harm's way, the ship regularly did so with little chance of immediate support against previously unknown enemies and threats.

Happily, the Enterprise's earliest engagement of its five-year mission, against a deceptively powerful starship called the Fesarius, ended with an amicable first contact with the First Federation in 2266. (TOS: "The Corbomite Maneuver") Following the destruction of a colony on Cestus III, a surprise attack – from a previously unknown species – led the Enterprise to battle and pursue an evenly matched Gorn starship in 2267. (TOS: "Arena")

The Enterprise played the fox for four of its "sister ships" in a war games problem on stardate 4729.4, as part of a series of M-5 drills. Equipped with the new M-5 multitronic unit computer and stripped of most of its crew, the Enterprise became a killing machine – crippling the USS Excalibur and killing its entire crew – before Kirk could re-assert control. (TOS: "The Ultimate Computer")

Klingon engagements

USS Enterprise-D7 face off
The Battle of Organia in 2267
Warships of the Imperial Klingon Fleet were frequent opponents of the Enterprise. Commander Kor held the Enterprise and Kirk in high professional regard, and relished the prospect of battle. Lower ranks chose to mock the starship; on one such occasion, Korax compared the vessel to a "garbage scow" before he corrected himself, adding, "It should be hauled away as garbage." (TOS: "Errand of Mercy", "The Trouble with Tribbles")

While Starfleet rallied its forces at the outbreak of a Federation-Klingon War in 2267, the Enterprise was sent forward to secure a border region anchored by the planet Organia. The vessel destroyed a Klingon ship and prepared to engage an approaching Klingon fleet, before the Organian Peace Treaty precluded a full-scale war. (TOS: "Errand of Mercy")

The Enterprise sporadically engaged Klingons throughout its voyage. A warship failed in an attempt to blockade the Enterprise from Capella IV in 2267. Sabotaged during a diplomatic mission to the Tellun system in 2268, the ship successfully fought off the assault of a harassing D7. The same year, the Enterprise was forced to destroy a battle cruiser that Kang had commanded but had recently abandoned, and the rescued Klingons (influenced by the Beta XII-A entity) subsequently made an unsuccessful attempt to wrest control of the Enterprise from Kirk. (TOS: "Friday's Child", "Elaan of Troyius", "Day of the Dove")

Romulan engagements

The Romulan Star Empire re-emerged from a century of isolation to antagonize the Federation with the Neutral Zone Incursion of 2266. The Enterprise responded and was victorious against a new Romulan Bird-of-Prey, which was equipped with a cloaking device and a plasma torpedo system. (TOS: "Balance of Terror")

In later encounters, the Romulan fleet used strength of numbers in their efforts to overwhelm the Enterprise. When Commodore Stocker took temporary command and violated the Neutral Zone in 2267, up to ten Birds-of-Prey swarmed and pummeled the starship until Kirk's "corbomite" bluff inspired their withdrawal. (TOS: "The Deadly Years")

In 2268, the Enterprise again violated the Neutral Zone – for the purpose of espionage – and was quickly surrounded by three Romulan D7-class battle cruisers. The Enterprise escaped by becoming the first Federation vessel to install and successfully utilize a (stolen) Romulan cloaking device. (TOS: "The Enterprise Incident")

Near Tau Ceti in the following year, Kirk employed the Cochrane deceleration maneuver, allowing the Enterprise to defeat a Romulan vessel. (TOS: "Whom Gods Destroy")

In the final year of Kirk's original mission, the ship was ambushed by a trio of Romulan battle cruisers while on a routine survey. The Enterprise managed to escape through an energy field that adversely affected the ship's main computer. The malfunctioning systems were corrected by another pass through the field, this time with the Romulan ships in pursuit. The attackers then became incapacitated by the same computer malfunctions, and the Enterprise managed to escape. (TAS: "The Practical Joker")

Refit of the 2270s

The Enterprise underwent another major refit into what would later be known as the Constitution II-class. The refitting took eighteen months of work, and essentially a new vessel was built onto the bones of the old, replacing virtually every major system. This ensured Enterprise's continued service for the next several years, enabling the ship to continue to serve in its prominent role.

Refits and overhauls with new technologies after long deployments were far from unusual in the ship's history. However, the Enterprise's overhaul of the early 2270s became a nearly keel-up redesign and reconstruction project.

The very heart of the ship was replaced with a radically different vertical warp core assembly, linked to new and heavier warp engine nacelles, atop swept-back pylons and integrated with the impulse engines. The new drive system allowed for an expanded cargo hold in the secondary hull, linked to the shuttlebay. The deflector dish at the front of the main housing was replaced with an entirely new design, one where it was recessed into the housing.

Weapons system upgrades included the phaser banks having power channeled directly from the warp engines. A double photon torpedo/probe launcher was installed atop the secondary hull.

Extra egress points were added for better access/exit from the ship and now included a port-side spacedock hatch, dual ventral space walk bays, four dorsal service hatches, and a standardized docking ring port, which was aft of the bridge on the primary hull. Also included were four more docking ring ports, paired on the port and starboard sides of the launcher and secondary hulls respectively, and service hatch airlocks on the port and starboard sides of the hangar bay's main clam-shell doors. Unlike from before the refit, these new egress points were not covered by retractable hull plating.

A new bridge module reflected the modern computer systems, operating interfaces, and ergonomics that ran throughout the ship.

Following Kirk's promotion to rear admiral and posting as Chief of Starfleet Operations, his successor, Captain Will Decker (whom Kirk himself picked to succeed him), oversaw the refit, assisted by chief engineer Commander Montgomery Scott. (Star Trek: The Motion Picture)

Following its refit, the Enterprise, in the early 2270s, went on to be critical in defending the Federation from several external threats, including V'ger and Khan Noonien Singh. (Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan)

V'ger

After eighteen months in drydock for refit, the Enterprise was pressed into service, weeks ahead of schedule, in response to the V'ger crisis, once again under Kirk's command.

Making contact with V'ger
Decker was temporarily demoted to commander and posted as an executive officer because of his familiarity with the new design. Incomplete systems had to be serviced during the vessel's shakedown en route to V'ger, including the first test of the new warp engines.

Shortly after launch, a matter/antimatter intermix malfunction ruptured the warp field and led to the Enterprise entering into an unstable wormhole. Commander Decker belayed an order from Admiral Kirk to destroy an asteroid in their path, which had been dragged into the ruptured warp field along with them, with phasers. The refitted phasers now channeled power directly from the main engines at a point beyond the dilithium/magnatomic-initiator stage.

Because of this refitted function, both the intermix malfunction and the resultant antimatter imbalance within the warp nacelles caused automatic cutoff of the phasers, a design change of which Kirk had not been aware. Decker ordered the use of photon torpedoes, instead; as a backup, they had been designed to draw power from a separate system in case of a major phaser loss. Commander Spock arrived at a timely point and brought correction to the intermix problem. (Star Trek: The Motion Picture)

Once the V'ger threat was averted, Captain Decker was listed as "missing in action", and the Enterprise remained under Admiral Kirk's command for an interim period. (Star Trek: The Motion Picture) At some point, Kirk passed command on to the newly promoted Captain Spock. (Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan)

Khan's return

In 2285, the Enterprise had been pulled from the front lines of Starfleet and the Federation and, near the end of its life, was relegated to a training vessel. The ship participated in a low-tempo training cycle, based in the Sol system. Admiral Kirk boarded his old command to observe a cadet training cruise.

Meanwhile, Khan Noonien Singh had escaped from exile on Ceti Alpha V and hijacked the USS Reliant, after which he stole the Genesis Device from the Regula I space station.

The Enterprise was tasked to investigate, and Spock deferred his command to Admiral Kirk. Subsequent engagements with Reliant left the ship badly damaged, with cadet and crew deaths, including Captain Spock. (Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan)

Final mission

Upon the Enterprise returning to Earth, Starfleet Commander Fleet Admiral Morrow announced that the starship, at that point forty years old and heavily damaged, would be decommissioned. When Morrow denied Kirk requesting permission to return to the Mutara sector, Kirk conspired with his senior officers and stole the Enterprise from Spacedock One, in order to recover Spock's body from the Genesis Planet – to bring it and Spock's katra, the latter possessed by Leonard McCoy, to Mount Seleya on Vulcan. As part of the plan, Kirk had Scott rig up an automation system to run the Enterprise so easily that "a chimpanzee and two trainees" could have handled the craft.

USS Enterprise self destructs
"My God, Bones… what have I done?" – Admiral James T. Kirk
At the Enterprise's destination, the ship was attacked by a Klingon Bird-of-Prey operated by Klingon Commander Kruge, an assault that left the Enterprise disabled; Scotty's automation system was not designed for combat and overloaded when the ship was attacked. After setting the auto-destruct sequence, Kirk and his crew abandoned the ship for the surface of the Genesis Planet. Demolition charges in place on the bridge, and elsewhere throughout the ship, exploded, killing a Klingon boarding party. The battered secondary hull (with what was left of the saucer) fell from orbit and blazingly streaked across the planet's atmosphere. (Star Trek III: The Search for Spock)
